\simple Project to control a green house

This project was made in 2014 for a subject, "Informatic II", on Electronic Engineering Career in Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional Facultad Regional Buenos Aires (UTN-FRBA). 
Its purpose is to control the lighting (if it is natural or needs to be artificial, so turn a lightbulb on), ventilation and warmth of a green house. It can be set the ideal ambient of different plants and flowers, through a computer program, also, self-made. 

This project has three different points:
  - Microprocessor: an LPC1769 was programmed on LPCXpresso, using CMSISv2p00 in C
  - Hardware: the HW used for this project was given by the Chair of the subject, and not self-made. 
  - Software: a computer software was created in C++ with QTCreator, which communicates with the used board through UART (serial communication).
